# Documentation - Step 1: Project Creation

> Goal: Create a “ralph-ai system” to support video game development 

## Summary
Step1: Define objectives, choose technology, design architecture, set up the environment, implement core features, test, document, and deploy/maintain.

## Step-by-step guide
1. **Define the goal and scope**
	- What problems should the system solve (assets, users, licenses, inventory, workflows)?
		> A turn-based, exploration-driven narrative game with no combat. Players navigate an atmospheric world one choice at a time, uncovering secrets, forging relationships, and steering a branching story whose paths and endings change based on what they investigate, who they trust, and how they spend their limited turns.
	- Who will use it (developers, artists, producers, admins)?
		> Gamers: the frontend will run on computers, smartphones, and consoles.

2. **Gather requirements**
	- What is in scope vs. out of scope for the first release?
		> Will be defined in Step 2 documentation. *coming soon*
	- Capture must-have vs. nice-to-have features vs. not required.
		> Custom system defined in Step 2 documentation. *coming soon*
	- Identify compliance needs (audit logs, license tracking, data retention).
		> No compliance needs in the first version. *coming soon*

3. **Choose the tech stack**
	- Backend: Node.js / Python / Java
		> Java Spring Boot (latest version) with REST API and WebSocket. In `backend` folder. *coming soon*
	- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL.
		> PostgreSQL. In `database` folder.  *coming soon*
	- Frontend: React / Vue
		> React with Redux and Bootstrap 5. In `frontend` folder. *coming soon*
	- Authentication: OAuth2 / SSO / LDAP
		> OAuth2 with integration with Google and Steam systems. *coming soon*
	- Hosting: Docker, cloud, or on‑premises
		> Runnable on‑premises or on a remote server with Docker/Kubernetes. Script in `scripts` folder. *coming soon*

4. **Design the architecture**
	- Define core modules: Assets, Users/Roles, Licenses, Inventory, Reports
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Define API style: REST or GraphQL or WebSocket
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder (REST, Swagger/OpenAPI, and WebSocket). *coming soon*
	- Define services
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*

5. **Develop**
	- List the minimal features to ship first.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Build the “ralph-ai system.”
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Run the ralph-ai
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*

6. **Set up the environment**
	- Repository structure and branching strategy.
		> Two repositories: backend and frontend (documentation only in the backend repository). *coming soon*
	- CI/CD pipeline and code quality checks.
		> Will be defined with Jenkins. *coming soon*
	- Environments: dev / staging / demo / prod.
		> Dev is local; demo and prod will be deployed in the cloud (AWS, Azure, ...). *coming soon*

7. **Testing and Documentation**
	- Unit tests for core logic.
		> Defined inside Java and React projects. *coming soon*
	- Integration tests for API + DB + UI.
		> Defined with Robot Framework. *coming soon*
	- User guide and admin guide.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Setup and deployment instructions.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*

8. **Deploy and maintain**
	- Automated releases and monitoring.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Distribute the project.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
	- Continuous improvements based on feedback.
		> Defined in a specific documentation file in this folder. *coming soon*
